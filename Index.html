<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This site is a place that encourages our community to spend time and spread joy to one another through series of events within our community providing the necessary help and having a pleasant time. It is owned by a council and itâ€™s the place where the people from the community meet to socialise or do activities, organise events and receive support. <br>The council would like to advertise the community centre and its facilities via a website as many people who live within an easy reach might not know about it.</br></p> 
<p> Below are some of the tabs that you may find intriguing regarding the website and what it entails for more information we reccomend you go to the pages provided to help you understand more on the events to come.</p>
